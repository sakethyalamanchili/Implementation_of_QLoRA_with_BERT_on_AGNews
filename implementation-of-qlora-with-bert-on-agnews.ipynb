It changed the field by allowing models to understand the context of a word based on all of its surroundings (both left and right), rather than just the words that come before or after it.\n","\n","### AG News Classification Overview\n","\n","**AG News** is a sub-collection of the AG Corpus, consisting of more than 1 million news articles. This specific subset is a popular benchmark for **Multi-class Text Classification** tasks in NLP.\n","\n","#### 1.

Target Categories\n","\n","1. **World (1):** Global politics, international relations, and general news.\n","2. **Sports (2):** Games, scores, athletes, and sporting events.\n","3. **Business (3):** Finance, stock markets, companies, and economy.\n","4. **Sci/Tech (4):** Technology, software, hardware, space, and science.\n","\n","#### 4. Significance\n","\n","* **Balanced Classes:** The dataset provides an equal number of samples per class, making **Accuracy** a reliable evaluation metric.\n","* **Real-world Application:** It tests a model's ability to extract semantic meaning from short, noisy text snippets typical of modern news feeds.\n","\n","\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"0d7c54a3","metadata":{"id":"50gT2U7Ld1bJ","papermill":{"duration":0.016003,"end_time":"2026-02-05T21:15:51.196791","exception":false,"start_time":"2026-02-05T21:15:51.180788","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":["## 1.

Training the Model\n","\n","With the dataset tokenized and the LoRA adapters injected, we now enter the active training phase. We utilize the Hugging Face `Trainer` API to orchestrate the fine-tuning process, specifically tuned for stability in a 4-bit quantized environment.\n","\n","### Evaluation Strategy & Metrics\n","\n","We define a `compute_metrics` function to monitor the model's performance during training.\n","\n","* **Argmax Logic:** The model outputs raw **logits** (scores) for each of the 4 news categories. We apply an `argmax` operation to select the category with the highest confidence.\n","* **Accuracy:** We use the `evaluate` library to benchmark our predictions against the ground-truth labels from the AG News validation set.\n","\n","### Training Configuration (`TrainingArguments`)\n","\n","The hyperparameters are carefully selected to balance training speed with the memory constraints of a single GPU:\n","\n","* **Learning Rate (`2e-4`)**: A slightly higher learning rate than standard fine-tuning is used here, as we are only updating a small number of adapter weights.\n","* **Batch Size (`16`)**: Set to 16 for both training and evaluation to maximize GPU throughput while staying within VRAM limits.\n","* **Check-pointing & Recovery**:\n","* **`load_best_model_at_end=True`**: At the end of training, the Trainer automatically reloads the version of the model that achieved the highest accuracy on the validation set.\n","* **`save_strategy=\"epoch\"`**: Saves the model state at the end of each epoch.\n","\n","### Critical Memory Optimizations\n","\n","Since we are working with a **4-bit quantized backbone**, standard backpropagation can be memory-intensive. We implement two key features:\n","\n","1. **Gradient Checkpointing**: This saves VRAM by not storing all intermediate activations during the forward pass; instead, they are re-computed during the backward pass.\n","2. **Re-entrant Override**: We set `use_reentrant: False` in the checkpointing kwargs. This is a critical fix for modern PyTorch versions that prevents potential tensor mismatch errors during the backward pass of a PEFT model.\n","\n","### Model Persistence\n","\n","Once training is complete, we call `model.save_pretrained()`.\n","\n","* **What is saved:** Only the **LoRA adapter weights** and the **trained classification head**.\n","* **Storage Efficiency:** The resulting folder is roughly **15-20 MB**, a massive contrast to the **440 MB+** of a standard BERT model. This makes the model highly portable for deployment in mobile or edge applications."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":9,"id":"b8e7ad64","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2026-02-05T21:17:15.512192Z","iopub.status.busy":"2026-02-05T21:17:15.511514Z","iopub.status.idle":"2026-02-05T21:40:56.686164Z","shell.execute_reply":"2026-02-05T21:40:56.685291Z"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":1199886,"status":"ok","timestamp":1770321559756,"user":{"displayName":"Saketh Yalamanchili","userId":"11081828641261172157"},"user_tz":300},"id":"0U5fO_kr6qCh","outputId":"8f9008db-74c8-4bc7-b2f6-677925f12b9f","papermill":{"duration":1421.196208,"end_time":"2026-02-05T21:40:56.687797","exception":false,"start_time":"2026-02-05T21:17:15.491589","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"outputs":[{"data":{"application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"model_id":"79022f23a9f2454cb4631ed5cc16d68a","version_major":2,"version_minor":0},"text/plain":["Downloading builder script: 0.00B [00:00, ?B/s]"]},"metadata":{},"output_type":"display_data"},{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["Starting training...\n"]},{"data":{"text/html":["\n","    <div>\n","      \n","      <progress value='6000' max='6000' style='width:300px; height:20px; vertical-align: middle;'></progress>\n","      [6000/6000 23:37, Epoch 1/1]\n","    </div>\n","    <table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n"," <tr style=\"text-align: left;\">\n","      <th>Epoch</th>\n","      <th>Training Loss</th>\n","      <th>Validation Loss</th>\n","      <th>Accuracy</th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","      <td>0.212100</td>\n","      <td>0.204187</td>\n","      <td>0.933167</td>\n","    </tr>\n","  </tbody>\n","</table><p>"],"text/plain":["<IPython.core.display.HTML object>"]},"metadata":{},"output_type":"display_data"},{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["Training took: 23.65 minutes\n","Model Adapter and Tokenizer Saved!\n"]}],"source":["# Metric calculation\n","accuracy = evaluate.load(\"accuracy\")\n","\n","def compute_metrics(eval_pred):\n","    predictions, labels = eval_pred\n","    predictions = predictions.argmax(axis=-1)\n","    return accuracy.compute(predictions=predictions, references=labels)\n","\n","# Training Arguments\n","training_args = TrainingArguments(\n","    output_dir=\"./bert-agnews-qlora\",\n","    learning_rate=2e-4,\n","    per_device_train_batch_size=16,\n","    per_device_eval_batch_size=16,\n","    num_train_epochs=1,\n","    weight_decay=0.01,\n","    eval_strategy=\"epoch\",\n","    save_strategy=\"epoch\",\n","    load_best_model_at_end=True,\n","    logging_steps=50,\n","    report_to=\"none\",\n","\n","    # --- CRITICAL MEMORY SETTINGS ---\n","    gradient_checkpointing=True,\n","    gradient_checkpointing_kwargs={\"use_reentrant\": False}\n",")\n","\n","# Trainer\n","trainer = Trainer(\n","    model=model,\n","    args=training_args,\n","    train_dataset=tokenized_dataset[\"train\"],\n","    eval_dataset=tokenized_dataset[\"validation\"],\n","    # tokenizer=tokenizer, # Removed to prevent TypeError\n","    compute_metrics=compute_metrics,\n",")\n","\n","# START TRAINING WITH TIMER\n","print(\"Starting training...\")\n","start_time = time.time()\n","\n","trainer.train()\n","\n","end_time = time.time()\n","training_duration = end_time - start_time\n","print(f\"Training took: {training_duration / 60:.2f} minutes\")\n","\n","# Save the final adapter and tokenizer\n","model.save_pretrained(\"./qlora_agnews_final\")\n","tokenizer.save_pretrained(\"./qlora_agnews_final\")\n","print(\"Model Adapter and Tokenizer Saved!\")"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"5ca51faf","metadata":{"id":"HLwnPNdGAoNR","papermill":{"duration":0.019067,"end_time":"2026-02-05T21:40:56.727426","exception":false,"start_time":"2026-02-05T21:40:56.708359","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":["## 8.
